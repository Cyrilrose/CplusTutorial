# University of Calabar C++ Programming Tutorial
This repository contains the course notes, programming assignments and their solutions for my UNICAL C++ Programming class.  
  
Materials are under development and subject to change.  
  
The course notes follows closely the textbook "C++ How to Program" by Paul & Harvey Deitel. So be sure to get one [here](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Objects-Version-Edition-Deitel/dp/0133378713) if you need to study deeper.
  
The C++ compiler of choice for this cource is DevC++ and can be downloaded [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/).

For enrolled students, Join us on the course's [Piazza discussion group](https://piazza.com/unical.edu.ng/spring2015/csc181/home).
