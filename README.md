# University of Calabar C++ Programming Tutorial
This repository contains the course notes, programming assignments and their solutions for my UNICAL C++ Programming class.  
  
Materials are under development and subject to change.  
  
The course notes follows closely the textbook "C++ How to Program" by Paul & Harvey Deitel. So be sure to get one [here](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Objects-Version-Edition-Deitel/dp/0133378713) if you need to study deeper.
  
The C++ compiler of choice for this cource is DevC++ and can be downloaded [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/).

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.
